# FitLit

## Setup

The details and setup of this project are outline in [this project spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

## Overview:

In this project, we were given data from an activity tracker for many users over many days. Think of something like Fitbit. Fitbit devices log data and present it on a dashboard for their users. Our goal was to present a useful dashboard for a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.

## Goals:

- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Refactor your code to DRY up repetitive logic
- Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility
- Practice talking about your code and high level technical concepts
- Implement feedback to improve product and process.


## Tech used:
- JavaScript
- Mocha
- Chai
- CSS
- HTML
- VS Code & Atom

## Challenges:
- Implementing the Fetch API
- The donut graph sizing was hard to fit to size
- Thinking of sad paths for testing
- Deciding on class structure and where each method should live

## Wins:
- Making our function dynamic made building the later classes much easier
- The initial planning of how we would approach the project
- The project board helped keep us on track


## Testing:
Mocha and chai are already set up, with a boilerplate test for you.

### Design Inspiration:
For this project we sourced inspiration from Dribble creators, and also used our imagination during the building process to make it our own!

### Example of Project:

### Scrolling feature:

### Future Additions:
- Functionality that allows the user to filter by date
- A feature that allows the user to change the color scheme
- Pictures to the design
